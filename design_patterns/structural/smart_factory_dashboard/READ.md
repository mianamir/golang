# Smart Factory Dashboard Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of various creational design patterns in the context of a "Smart Factory Dashboard" application. The application simulates a factory environment where sensors, machines, and their data are managed through a central dashboard.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into different modules, each representing a specific creational design pattern and its usage.

- `factory_method`: Implements the Factory Method pattern for creating different types of sensors.
- `abstract_factory`: Demonstrates the Abstract Factory pattern for creating sensor families for different machine types.
- `singleton`: Illustrates the Singleton pattern for managing a single instance of the factory dashboard.
- `builder`: Shows the Builder pattern in constructing complex machine objects.
- `prototype`: Utilizes the Prototype pattern for creating new machine objects by copying existing ones.
- `object_pool`: Implements the Object Pool pattern for managing a pool of reusable machine objects.
- `main`: The main application entry point that brings together all the patterns.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Golang installed on your system.

2. Clone this repository:

3. Navigate to the project directory:

4. Run the main application:

The application will execute and demonstrate each creational design pattern, showcasing how they can be used to enhance the architecture of a "Smart Factory Dashboard."

## Usage Notes

- Each module contains comments explaining the implementation of the respective creational design pattern.
- The application's purpose is educational, focusing on design patterns. In a real-world scenario, you'd integrate these patterns more seamlessly.
- Feel free to modify and expand the application according to your needs and further explore other design patterns and concepts.
